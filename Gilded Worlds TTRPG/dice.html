    <br><h1 id="d100s">d100s</h1>
    <br><p>This system uses a similar system to that of Call of Cthulhu or Delta Green, in that it uses the d100 dice system. The player rolls a d100 (or multiple if given advantage or disadvantage), and succeeds if the rolled number is <em>below</em> the target/maximum number.</p>
    <br><h2 id="modifiers">Modifiers</h2>
    <br><h3 id="critical-doubles-11s-rule-">Critical Doubles (11s Rule)</h3>
    <br><p>Any dice roll where all the numbers are the same (e.g 11, 22, 44, 99) are counted as crits, the type depending on whether or not the rolled number is above or below the target.</p>
    <br><blockquote>
    <br><p>If the roll is <em>below</em> the target, the roll is a Critical Success</p>
    <br><p>If the roll is <em>above</em> the target, the roll is a Critical Failure</p>
    <br></blockquote>
    <br><h3 id="advantage-and-disadvantage">Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
    <br><p>The GM can give players and characters advantage or disadvantage on their rolls, adding extra dice rolls to their checks.</p>
    <br><h4 id="advantage">Advantage</h4>
    <br><p>When given Advantage, a character must roll their check multiple times, the amount equal to the amount of advantage given (+1 for the base roll), and must take the <em>lower</em> number (the better roll).</p>
    <br><blockquote>
    <br><p>For example, if given 1 advantage on a roll, the player would roll 2 d100s, e.g. 43 and 67, and would take the lower roll, in this example, 43.</p>
    <br></blockquote>
    <br><p>There is also Optional Advantage, where the character/player can instead choose which roll they wish to use.</p>
    <br><blockquote>
    <br><p>For example, if given 1 optional advantage on a roll, the player would roll 2 d100s, e.g. 43 and 67, and can choose which roll they would like to take, either the 43 <em>or</em> the 67.</p>
    <br></blockquote>
    <br><h4 id="disadvantage">Disadvantage</h4>
    <br><p>Disadvantage works as the inverse of [[Dice and Check System#Advantage|Advantage]]. When given Disadvantage, a character must roll their check multiple times, the amount equal to the amount of advantage given (+1 for the base roll), and must take the <em>higher</em> number (the worse roll).</p>
    <br><blockquote>
    <br><p>For example, if given 1 advantage on a roll, the player would roll 2 d100s, e.g. 43 and 67, and would take the lower roll, in this example, 43.</p>
    <br></blockquote>
    <br><h3 id="-modifier">+/- Modifier</h3>
    <br><p>The GM can give players/characters a plus or minus to their roll, where the modifier changes the number the roll must be under. The GM can choose any number to add or subtract from the target value, depending on given circumstances.</p>
    <br><blockquote>
    <br><p>For example, if given a +20 to a roll where the original target number was 50 or below, the effective target number becomes 70 or below, effectively making the roll <em>easier</em>.</p>
    <br><p>Conversely, if given a -20 to a roll, given the same situation, the effective target number becomes a 30 or below, effectively making the roll <em>harder</em>.</p> 
    <br></blockquote>
