            <h3>Dice System: Percentile</h3>
            <p>
                The <b>Gilded Worlds</b> TTRPG system uses a Percentile Die system for most checks and rolls, meaning that you roll a d100 (or two d10s) which represents a percentage value.
            </p>

            <h3>Checks</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>Check Styles</h4>
                There are a series of different kinds of checks, though most you encounter during gameplay would follow a regular check ruling.<br><br>
                <ul style="color: #e0d9bd;">
                    <li>Regular Checks<br>
                        <small>A d100 is rolled, with the intent of rolling beneath a target value, usually the Percentage Value of the skill or stat being checked.<br>
                        If the value is below the threshold, it is considered a success. Above, and it is considered a failure.<br><br></small>
                    </li> 

                    <li>Inverted Checks<br>
                        <small>As with the Regular Checks, a d100 is rolled, but rather than aiming for below the treshold, you are aiming for above.<br>
                        As such, a value above the threshold is considered a success, and below; a failure.<br><br></small>
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>Neutral Checks<br>
                        <small>As per the other styles of checks, you roll a d100, but the target threshold is simply a 50%, or whatever number is specified by the GM.<br>
                        This is usually done Regular, so > threshold = success, but can be inverted for some interesting effects.<br><br></small>
                    </li>
                </ul><br>

                <h4>Criticals</h4>
                <h5>Critical Doubles</h5>
                Any dice roll where both the Ones and Tens are identical (i.e. 11, 22, 44, 77, 99) are considered Critical.<br> Depending on the success of failure determined by the threshold, Criticals amplify the effects.<br>
                <br>

                <h5>Critical Extremes</h5>
                Any dice roll at the extreme ends of the scale, a Natural 1, a Natural 99, and a Natural 100, are considered Extreme or Critical Successes and Failures respectively.<br>
                I generally treat them as slightly better than Doubles, but thats obviously up to preference and discretion.
                <br>

            </p><br>

            <h3>Difficulty Modifiers</h3>
            <p>

                <h4>Advantage and Disadvantage</h4>
                As with many systems, the GM can, depending on their whims and events in the world, give Advantage or Disadvantage to change the success rates of a given check. <br>
                In this system, both Advantage and Disadvantage allow you to re-roll both die (both the 100s and 10s), fully rerolling. On advantage, you take the lower of the rolls, on disadvantage you take the higher, this is swapped for Inverted checks.<br>

                <h4>Difficulty Levels</h4>
                On top of Advantages, you can also change the Difficulty Level of a check, which alters the total Percentage Threshold the check is comparing against.<br>
                They are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Normal <small>A regular difficulty check, Threshold is the full original value</small></li>
                    <li style="color: #ffe5a0;">Hard <small>Threshold becomes half the original value</small></li>
                    <li style="color: #ffc8aa;">Extreme <small>Threshold becomes one quarter the original value</small></li>
                    <li style="color: #ffcfc9;">Critical <small>Threshold becomes one tenth the original value</small></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Percentage Mods</h4>
                Percentage Mods are a more variable and precise way of altering a check's difficulty beyond Advantages or Difficulty Levels. 
                <br>Like Difficulty Levels, they modify the Threshold a check compares against, but Percentage Mods add or subtract from that Threshold by the specified number.
                <br>For Example, modifying a 70% Threshold with a +15%  would make the new Threshold 85%, thus making the check easier. Conversely subtracting 15% from a 70% Threshold would result in a 55%, thus making the check harder.
