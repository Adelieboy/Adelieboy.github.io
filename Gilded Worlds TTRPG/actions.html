    <br><h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
    <br><p>Actions in turns are done by expending Action Points (AP), which regenerate at the start of each turn. Different actions take different amounts of AP to do, where some restore AP instead.</p>
    <br><p>A single turn takes place over approximately 30s-1min in world-time. </p>
    <br><p>With no modifications, a character begins each turn with 3 Action Points, to be spent how they wish. If a character ends their turn with any remaining action points, they are carried over to the next turn. 
    <br>Each character also has a maximum amount of Action Points they can hold at a time, the default being 5</p>
    <br><h2 id="movement">Movement</h2>
    <br><p>Movement is decided by a Distance per Action Point, the distance a character can move is dependant on their [[Character Sheet#Athletics|Athletics]] stat, as shown in the below table. This can be modified through backgrounds, spells, equipment, etc.</p>
    <br><table>
    <br><thead>
    <br><tr>
    <br><th>Skill %</th>
    <br><th>Movement /AP</th>

    <br><td>70m (229.6ft)</td>
    <br></tr>
    <br></tbody>
    <br></table>
    <br><h2 id="attacks">Attacks</h2>
    <br><p>Basic melee and unarmed attacks cost 1AP, but can be enhanced with abilities or moves that may cost more.
    <br>Ranged weapon attacks all cost 2AP, regardless of hip firing, aiming, weapon type, etc.</p>
    <br><h2 id="spells">Spells</h2>
    <br><p>Spells, since they are carved as glyphs or spell circles, take more AP to cast than most attacks, however the upside is that you can hold a spell as long as you&#39;d like once its been cast.
    <br>A spell carved with only one glyph takes 1AP, a spell of 2 or 3 glyphs takes 2AP, and a spell carved with all 4 glyphs costs 3AP.
    <br>Holding and releasing (firing/casting) a spell costs 0AP</p>
    <br><h2 id="interactions">Interactions</h2>
    <br><p>Most environmental interactions cost 1AP, however some, such as picking up a small object, vaulting a small barrier during movement, cost none.</p>
