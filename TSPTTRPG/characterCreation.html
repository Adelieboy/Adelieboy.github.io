    <h1>Character Creation</h1><hr width="60%">
    <p>This page discusses the guidelines for NPC and Player Character Creation, and as such is written a little shakily, as I'm still figuring out the rules myself.<br>
    Because of this, expect this page to change dramatically at random times, as I figure out what works best.</p>
    <div class="break"></div>

    <h2 id="Aspects and Skills">Aspects and Skills</h2><hr width="60%">
    <p style="justify-content: center; width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;">Each player character and NPC has many different numbers that modify their rolls, either positively or negatively.
    The two that will likely come up most during regular gameplay, are <b style="color: gold;">Aspects</b> and <b style="color: palevioletred;">Skills</b>.</p><br>

    <p style="justify-content: center; width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;"><b style="color: gold;">Aspects</b> refer to generic stats such as <b>Strength (Str)</b> or <b>Intelligence (Int)</b>, and are used in much the same way as in DnD.<br>
    The values of these are asigned similarly to games such as Fallout, in that you assign a series of points (the default total being 8) to the chosen stats, with the addition of being able to remove a point from the default of 0. A single <b style="color:gold;">Aspect</b>'s value can not exceed 3, and cannot be any lower than -1.
    These values, unless stated otherwise by the DM, should not be modified after character creation, and do not level up.</p><br>

    <p style="justify-content: center; width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;"><b style="color: palevioletred;">Skills</b>, however, refer to more specific stats, such as <b>Medicine</b> or <b>Info Search</b>. These are assigned based on the stat spread shown, and also are not modified, unless otherwise altered by an item or effect.</p>
    <br><details><summary>Stat Spread</summary><br>
        +3, +3, +2, +2, +1, +1, +1, 0, 0, -1, -1, -2</details><div class="break"></div>

    <h2 id="Wounds, Sanity and Dread">Wounds, Sanity and Dread</h2><hr width="60%">
    <h3>Wounds</h3><br>
    <p style="justify-content: center; width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;">
    <b style="color:blueviolet">Wounds</b> are a measurement of sustained injuries, for example deep cuts or broken legs. They are used as the health of the character, where if a character reaches +5 or more <b style="color:blueviolet">wounds</b>, they are knocked down.
    A knocked character can be restored to being playable if they are healed to +3 or below. If a character reaches +7 or higher, they are killed, permanantly removed from play. If a character has reached +7 <b style="color:blueviolet">wounds</b> on the same turn they would have been knocked down, they get 1 turn to be healed to +5, or the death condition applies.<br>
    The type of <b style="color:blueviolet">wound</b> matters, and can (as decided by the DM) affect certain rolls. For example, if a character has a <b>Broken Leg</b>, they may gain a <b>Disadvantage Die</b> to any <b>Dexterity</b> rolls.<br>
    Unless otherwise stated or discussed, all characters start at 0 <b style="color:blueviolet">wounds</b>.
    </p><div class="break"></div>

    <h3>Sanity</h3><br>
    <p style="justify-content: center; width: 50%; margin-left: 25%;">
        <b style="color:purple">Sanity</b> describes the mental state of a character, starting at a default of +2. Sanity can be lost in a plethora of ways, from seeing something disgusting or horrifying, to coming across an otherworldly being.
        It can also be increased, albeit infrequently, such as by finding something calming or relaxing.<br>
        <b style="color:purple">Sanity</b> is about as important as <b style="color:blueviolet">Wounds</b>, because if a <b style="color:purple">Sanity</b> score reaches -5 or below, it returns to 0, but applies a stack of <b style="color:crimson">Dread</b>.<br>
        <b style="color:purple">Sanity</b> rolls are modified by reducing the final roll value by twice the character's <b style="color:crimson">Dread</b> value.
