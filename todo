1. Reformat for mobile
    a. Rebuild site with Mobile First in mind
    b. Figure out a way to test on mobile without pushing a commit?

2. Fix for every browser

3. Figure out (and use) "embeded pages" or whatever it's called
    By this I mean being able to click/tap on something, and rather than opening a new page, it opens a tab on top.

4. Figure out (and use) more dynamic pieces of html.
    e.g.
        'Three Lines' Button, that expands to show navBar pieces
