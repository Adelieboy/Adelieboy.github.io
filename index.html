    <h1>The Journey</h1>
    <hr width="60%">
    <br>

        <h3>The Beginning</h3><br>
            <p>The journey begins with me thinking to myself <i>"I have some kinda neat ideas for games, but I cant find any games that do what I'm thinking of."</i>, as I'm sure many other indie developers think. <br>
            This sparked enough of an interest in making my own games, that soon, I'd downloaded Unity and started watching tutorials. <br>
            The first idea to be brought into existence in any manner was reffered to as:</p>

        <br><br>
        <h3>ElementsGame</h3>
            <h5>My first real foray into code.</h5><br>
            <p>The idea begins as an attempt to emulate, in game form, the element bending of <b>Avatar: The Last Airbender</b>.</p>
            Step one, of course, is to create the elements to be moved and manipulated by the player. <br>
            After a good deal of thinking, I'd decided to make it into a puzzle game, utilising as much physically accurate, well, physics, as I could. <br>
            This ends up as the beginning of my battle with Scope Creep. A battle that for this project, I lost... But lets not get ahead of myself. <br>
            A few days of coding and tutorial watching later, and I'd created the base of the game. Elements, and 'bending' them! <br>
            <img src="Images/TheJourney/elm1.png" alt="elm1" class="jImg">
            <p>Look at that! Water, Fire, and Earth. Each spawnable and controllable via thier related element bending!</p>
            The next step, of course, was to add a way to actually gather these elements. The best I came up with? A couple "Sources", related to each element. <br>
            <img src="Images/TheJourney/elmS1.png" alt="elmS1" class="jImg">
            <p>The elemental sources function by simply holding the 'bending' button when close to the source. Neat!</p>
            You may be wondering <i>"Well, where is the Air element? Surely Air must be here somewhere!"</i>, and to that i say: It's all around you! <br>
            That's right, no manipulatable air element, but instead, bending it lets you double jump and move faster! <br>
            Now, originally this game was going to have a mana system, but that never saw much implementation. Instead, I began trying out some random travel techniques. <br>
            The game was intented to be set on a large island, with puzzles scattered around that you'd have to solve using different elements. In keeping with that, I'd decided that to travel around the island faster, you'd use portal doors! <br>
            <img src="Images/TheJourney/elmPort1.png" alt="elmPort1" class="jImg">
            <p>After a lot of tutorial watching, I'd constructed a working portal from one end of the island to the other. A surprisingly unhelpful addition, considerring almost no gameplay had been implemented.</p>   
            This, sadly, is where this project effectively died, as I'd made too big of a project for myself to handle, and had begun looking at enrolling in tafe. <br>
            I do plan, eventually, to resurrect this project in some manner, because I did learn a lot, and enjoyed some of the ideas.
        </p>
